<p>In March 1975, thirty-two computer enthusiasts met in Gordon French’s garage around an Altair 8800 computer. No one had seen anything like it, and they shared whatever information they had. Steve Dompier had actually been to MITS in Albuquerque to pick up an Altair, and he described an overworked staff trying to catch up with a flood of orders. They had already shipped 1500 machines and were working hard to get the next 1100 out the door. What’s more, the company would deliver none of the much-needed accessories until they filled the outstanding orders for the basic machine. This news was about all Dompier had to show for his trip: he ended up leaving Albuquerque without significant chunks of the Altair kit he had bought and paid for.</p>
